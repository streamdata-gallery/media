apis:
- name: link.fish - Get social media accounts
  x-api-slug: urlssocialmedia-get
  description: |-
    Visits the URL and checks if there are any social media accounts and returns the found ones.

    Will by default return the account identifiers and not the full URL to the profiles. To return URLs instead set the parameter "return_urls" to true.

    The URLs can also be created manually like this:

    | Property        | URL                                    |
    | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | facebookPage    | https://facebook.com/{ID}              |
    | githubUser      | https://github.com/{ID}                |
    | googlePlus      | https://plus.google.com/+{ID}          |
    | instagram       | https://instagram.com/{ID}             |
    | linkedInCompany | https://linkedin.com/company/{ID}      |
    | pinterest       | https://pinterest.com/{ID}             |
    | twitter         | https://twitter.com/{ID}               |
    | youTubeUser     | https://youtube.com/user/{ID}          |

    Properties only get set when a value for it has been found. That means that if no social media account has been found only the property "url" will be set.
